# Gren

Compiler for the Gren programming language.

If you wish to install the compiler, you might want to read the [setup instructions](https://gren-lang.org/install).

## Build from source

Then Gren compiler is written in Haskell, so to build from source you need to have GHC 9.2.2 (haskell compiler) and cabal 3.6 (haskell build tool) installed on your system.

Compiling the project should just be a matter of running `cabal build`, or `cabal install` if you wish to install the compiler on your machine.

Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md]() file for some helpful commands for working on the compiler itself.
